Hospitality Process Digitalization
Overview
The Hospitality Process Digitalization project aims to streamline the room allocation process for group accommodations in hostels. This web application allows users to upload CSV files containing group information and hostel details. It then allocates rooms based on specified criteria, such as group size, gender requirements, and hostel capacities, ensuring an efficient and fair allocation process.

Key Features
CSV File Upload: Upload CSV files (groups.csv and hostels.csv) to initiate the allocation process.
Room Allocation Algorithm: Automatically allocates rooms based on group size and gender requirements (single or mixed gender groups).
Interactive Results Display: Displays allocated rooms grouped by hostel and room number, along with unallocated members and summary statistics.
Downloadable CSV Files: Option to download CSV files containing allocated members (allocated_members.csv) and unallocated members (unallocated_members.csv).
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface designed for ease of use.
