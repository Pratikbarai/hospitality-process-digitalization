Hospitality Process Digitalization
The Hospitality Process Digitalization project aims to simplify and optimize the room allocation process for group accommodations in hostels. This web application allows users to upload CSV files containing group information and hostel details, and then automates the room allocation based on specified criteria.

Key Features
CSV File Upload: Upload groups.csv (group information) and hostels.csv (hostel details) to initiate room allocation.

Room Allocation Algorithm: Automatically allocates rooms based on group size and gender requirements (single or mixed gender groups).

Interactive Results Display: Displays allocated rooms grouped by hostel and room number, along with unallocated members and summary statistics.

Downloadable CSV Files: Option to download CSV files containing allocated members (allocated_members.csv) and unallocated members (unallocated_members.csv).

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface designed for ease of use.
